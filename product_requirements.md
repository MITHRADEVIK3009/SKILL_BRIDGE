Backend:

API Endpoint for LLM Interaction: Implement a secure and efficient RESTful API endpoint (/api/llm/query) that accepts user input and returns the LLM's response. This endpoint should handle authentication and rate limiting.
LLM Integration Module: Develop a modular backend component responsible for interacting with the chosen LLM (e.g., Azure AI). This module should handle API requests, response parsing, and error handling.
Data Storage for Quiz Content: Design and implement a database schema to store quiz questions, answer options, correct answers, and potentially explanations. Consider scalability and maintainability.
User Authentication and Authorization: Implement a secure user authentication system (e.g., JWT) to manage user accounts and ensure only authenticated users can access certain features and their progress.
Quiz Progress Tracking: Develop a mechanism to track individual user progress through quizzes, including scores, completed questions, and timestamps. This data should be persistently stored.
Background Task Management: Implement a system for managing background tasks, such as asynchronous LLM interactions or potentially scheduled content updates.
API Documentation: Generate comprehensive API documentation (e.g., using Swagger/OpenAPI) for all backend endpoints to facilitate frontend integration.
Frontend:

Voice Input Handling: Implement robust voice input functionality that accurately captures user speech and converts it to text for quiz answers and LLM queries. Handle different accents and background noise.
Text-to-Speech Integration: Integrate a reliable TTS library to synthesize the AI's text responses into natural-sounding voice output. Allow users to control speech rate and volume.
Real-time UI Updates: Ensure the user interface updates dynamically to reflect quiz progress, AI responses, and any feedback. Optimize for smooth transitions and responsiveness.
State Management: Implement a scalable state management solution (e.g., Provider, BLoC, Riverpod) to manage the application's data and UI state effectively.
Responsive UI Design: Develop a user interface that adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes and orientations (mobile, tablet).
Error Handling and User Feedback: Implement clear and informative error handling for network requests, API failures, and unexpected issues. Provide appropriate feedback to the user.
AI and LLM Features:

Context Management for LLM: Implement a mechanism to maintain context during a user's interaction with the LLM, allowing for follow-up questions and more coherent conversations.
Prompt Engineering: Design effective prompts to guide the LLM to provide accurate, helpful, and relevant explanations and answers related to coding concepts.
Product Owner Requirements:

Backend:

Scalability and Performance: The backend architecture should be designed to handle a growing number of users and increasing API requests without performance degradation.
Security: Implement robust security measures to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access to the API and backend systems.
Frontend:

User Experience (UX) Optimization: The application should provide an intuitive and engaging user experience for learning to code through voice interaction. Conduct user testing to identify areas for improvement.
Accessibility: Ensure the application is accessible to users with disabilities, adhering to accessibility guidelines (e.g., WCAG).
AI and LLM Features:

AI Feature Evaluation Metrics: Define key metrics to evaluate the effectiveness and usefulness of the AI-powered features (e.g., user satisfaction with explanations, accuracy of LLM responses, impact on learning outcomes). Implement tracking to monitor these metrics.
